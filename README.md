# Retro Mobile Phones
## Introduction
Before the advent of smartphones, mobile telephones in English-speaking countries used keypads with buttons similar to below:

The keys are used for *both* calling numbers and texting messages; each key from 2-9 has a corresponding set of letters which 
can be used to input text. For example, pressing key 5 results in an output of 'j', 'k' or 'l'. As keys are progressively input, a 
predictive entry feature is used to display the closest match for the word.  

Special keys include '\*' which cycles through the possible matches for the current word, the'0' character which accepts 
the match for the word and adds a space and 'C' which removes the last entered character (or entire word if the word has been
'accepted').
